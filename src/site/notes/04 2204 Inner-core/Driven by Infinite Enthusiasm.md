# Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm 

- Which lectures? (order is not strict)
	- Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus by Shifrin (added below)
	- Classical Physics by Balki (added below)
	- Non-linear dynamics by Balki
	- < fluid mechanics >
	- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- (short) Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy
	- Differential Geometry	by Claudio Arezzo 
	- Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross 
	- General Relativity by T Paddy
	- (book) LandauL volumes I and II
		- I - for mechanics 
		- II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
	- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
		- for more theory Griffiths, Jackson(F)
- How to do lectures?
	- Complete each lecture and tick the check box. 
	- Make lecture notes in physical notebook.
		- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
		- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.

# Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus

This fairly rigorous but very entertaining set of lectures (where the instructor uses blackboard!) explains all the stuff in Multivariable calculus one encounters during the core years of a Fundamental Sciences programme: multiple derivatives, _volumous_ integrals, change of coordinates, and especially does everything in a proper linear algebraic setting (which becomes very important in the long run) and with lots of examples and pictures!

## Outline

> This two-semester class is a theoretical and more challenging amalgamation ... Proofs of theorems and additional physical applications will be stressed, and harder computational problems will be included.

The set of lectures is actually a two semester course, with mixed together description of various methods in Linear algebra and Calculus in ℝⁿ.
   ### First semester

- [Homepage](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/)
- [Course Syllabus](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Syllabus14.pdf)
- Vector algebra and geometry, matrices, linear maps, determinants.
2. Functions, limits, continuity; the derivative.
3. Solving linear systems: Gaussian elimination, linear independence, basis and dimension. What is
a manifold?
4. Maximum/minimum problems, quadratic forms, projections.
### Second semester
- [Homepage](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/)
- [Course Syllabus](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Syllabus15.pdf)
5. Integration, applications to physics, determinants and the change of variables theorem.
6. Nonlinear problems and manifolds.
7. Differential forms and integration on manifolds. Stokes’s Theorem. Applications to physics (div, curl, and all that) and topology.
8. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, difference and differential equations, spectral theorem and applications to quadratic forms.

## Instructor’s description

This is an integrated year-long course in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. It includes all the material in MATH 2270/2500 and MATH 3000, along with additional applications and theoretical material. There is greater emphasis on proofs, and the pace is quick. Typically the class consists of a blend of sophomores and freshmen who've earned a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. The text is my book, [Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047152638X.html).

Students who would like some guidance in reading and writing proofs might want to look at a wonderful new book called [How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics](http://library.lol/main/E46132BF2DB1C18E7E309CBF5A92A636), by Kevin Houston, Cambridge University Press, 2009.
